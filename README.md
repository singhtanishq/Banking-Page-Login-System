-  After successful login, user gets the option to logout anytime
  
- Once, user clicks on logout button, the current sesssion closes and user is redirected to the login page again
  
- Apart from login page, user can also navigate to About us, Contact us and Home page
  
- Home page allows user to click on Internet Banking button, that redirects to login page

- Rendering and hovering effects has been done properly using cascading style sheet

- The overall UI of the banking page has been created as accurate as the real banking page
